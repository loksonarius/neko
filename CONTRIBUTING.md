## Context

Given this is a CLI that can be used on many platforms, I'd love to hear what
your use case is and how the tool has failed to meet it. This can be unexpected
behavior, runtime error, unhandled edge case, unachieved requirements, etc. This
is generally what I would refer to as context, and I love me some yummy context
when it comes to projects. :yum:

## Issues

_bugs, errors, crashes_

When opening an issue, any sample data or templates that could help reproduce
whatever you're running into if it's a bug or such.

## Suggestions

_roadmap, novelty, big items_

For suggestions on brand new functionality, it'll be be great to know what
benefits you expect from that feature. This can be practical, novel, or humorous
-- I'll take any! :smile:

# Requests

_features, asks, small items_

Requests are very similar to [suggestions](#suggestions), and I'd expect similar
information, though I particularly request information on how `Neko` is failing
to meet your use case.

## Pull Requests

Normally, I'd include code and style guidelines here, but I'm honestly a scrub
at Rust. Instead I present the following requests as my minimum for considering
a PR:

- The PR _must_ be opened against the `dev` branch of this repo
- [Context](#context) _must_ be provided in the description
- Documentation updates _must_ be added for user-facing changes
- New code _must_ compile through the accompanying pipeline run
- A pug image or emojii _should_ be added at the end of the PR description
- :snowman:
